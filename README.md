# HomeLab 🏠🔒  

## 🎯 Objective  
This folder contains my write-ups for home lab projects focused on **detection, monitoring, and security research**. My goal is to build a structured cybersecurity homelab to test security tools, analyze network traffic, and simulate real-world attack scenarios.  

## 🛠 Tools  

| **Category**         | **Tool/Hardware**     | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **💻 Hardware**      | MacBook Pro M2        | Primary system running **VMware Fusion** for virtualization |
|                     | Proxmox               | Available but not yet in use |
|                     | Flipper Zero          | Various testing and tool experimentation |
|                     | Raspberry Pi          | Future expansion for additional projects |
| **🌐 Network & Security** | Ubuntu Server      | Acting as a firewall ([Setup Guide](/HomeLab/ubuntu-kali-setup.md)) |
|                     | Wireshark             | Packet analysis and network forensics |
|                     | Nmap & Shodan         | Scanning, discovery, and reconnaissance |
| **🖥️ Virtual Machines** | Kali Linux           | Offensive security testing environment |
|                     | Parrot OS             | Alternative pentesting and forensic analysis platform |
| **📊 Planned Additions** | Wazuh                | SIEM and log monitoring |
|                     | ELK Stack             | Log analysis and visualization |

## 📝 Notes  

### 🔧 **Initial Setup**  
- Installed **VMware Fusion** and set up **Kali Linux** and **Parrot OS** VMs  
- Configured **Ubuntu Server** as a firewall ([Guide in Progress](/HomeLab/ubuntu-kali-setup.md))  

### 🚀 **Next Steps**  
- Deploy and configure **SIEM tools** such as Wazuh and ELK Stack  
- Set up **vulnerable VMs** for exploitation practice  
- Expand monitoring capabilities within the lab  

### ⚠️ **Challenges & Learnings**  
- Troubleshooting VM networking issues and firewall rules  
- Optimizing resource allocation for virtualization  
- Identifying and mitigating security misconfigurations
